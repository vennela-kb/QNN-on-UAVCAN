## Additional Terms of Use

### 1. Research and Educational Use

This software was developed as part of a research project titled:

**"Exploring Quantum Circuit Applications in CAN Bus Data Analysis using QNN on UAVCAN"**

It is intended for academic, educational, and non-commercial use only. Any application of this software 
for commercial, defense, or mission-critical deployment must be preceded by written consent from the author.

Please cite the original research if this project contributes to a publication, report, or academic outcome.

### 2. Quantum Computing Limitations

This software includes models and methods that simulate or leverage quantum neural networks (QNNs). 
The code and circuits may rely on approximations or theoretical constructs not yet fully supported 
by quantum hardware. Performance claims are to be interpreted within the context of academic simulation 
environments and not as real-time quantum computing benchmarks.

### 3. Use with Autonomous Systems

This project may include models that analyze CAN bus data typical in unmanned aerial vehicles or 
robotic systems. The methods provided here are for experimentation and benchmarking only. 

No safety, reliability, or operational guarantees are provided when interfacing with live systems.

Use of the models on actual UAVs or autonomous platforms must follow strict validation and 
compliance with applicable aerospace safety standards.

### 4. Export Compliance

The quantum, machine learning, and autonomous systems aspects of this software may be subject to 
international regulations concerning export, especially in sensitive jurisdictions.

It is the responsibility of the end user to ensure compliance with their national and regional 
laws regarding the distribution and usage of this software.

### 5. Contributions

Contributions are welcome and appreciated. By submitting contributions, you agree that they will 
be released under the same MIT License and subject to these extended terms of use.
