# Execution Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`Execution.ipynb`) is designed to execute and explore **Quantum Computing** and **Quantum Machine Learning** concepts using `Qiskit`. The notebook includes steps to install necessary dependencies, configure the quantum environment, and execute quantum-related computations, including quantum circuits, state preparation, and quantum machine learning models.

## Features
- **Quantum Circuit Implementation**: Demonstrates fundamental quantum gates (`H`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `CX`, `CCX`, `T`, `S`) and their effects on qubits.
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Utilizes `qiskit-machine-learning` to train and test quantum-based models for classification and regression tasks.
- **Quantum Simulations**: Uses `qiskit-aer` to simulate quantum experiments on classical hardware.
- **IBM Quantum Backend Integration**: Connects to IBM Q for executing quantum circuits on real quantum computers.
- **Error Mitigation Techniques**: Explores quantum error correction methods such as **mitigation of noise** and **quantum error correction codes**.

## Dependencies
To run this notebook successfully, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `qiskit`
- `qiskit-machine-learning`
- `qiskit-aer`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`

You can install them using the following commands:
```sh
pip install qiskit qiskit-machine-learning qiskit-aer matplotlib numpy scipy pandas --upgrade
```

## Usage
### 1. Clone or Download the Notebook
   - If you're running locally, ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed.
   - If using Google Colab, upload the notebook and run the cells sequentially.

### 2. Install Dependencies
   - Run the initial setup cells to install Qiskit and related libraries.

### 3. Configure the Quantum Environment
   - If running on IBM Quantum hardware, set up your IBM Q credentials using:
   ```python
   from qiskit import IBMQ
   IBMQ.save_account('YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_API_KEY')
   IBMQ.load_account()
   ```
   - Ensure that your API key is securely stored and not exposed.

### 4. Execute Quantum Computation
   - The notebook contains several sections, including:
     - **Quantum Circuit Construction**: Defines single and multi-qubit operations.
     - **Quantum Measurement**: Executes measurements on quantum registers and visualizes outcomes using histograms.
     - **Simulating Quantum Circuits**: Uses `qiskit-aer` to emulate quantum execution.
     - **Machine Learning with Quantum Data**: Implements quantum feature maps and variational classifiers.
   - Example code snippet for creating and visualizing a simple quantum circuit:
   ```python
   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, transpile, assemble, execute
   from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

   # Create a Quantum Circuit with 2 qubits
   qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
   qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate to qubit 0
   qc.cx(0, 1)  # Apply CNOT gate (entanglement)
   qc.measure_all()
   
   # Execute the circuit using Aer simulator
   simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
   transpiled_qc = transpile(qc, simulator)
   qobj = assemble(transpiled_qc)
   result = execute(qc, simulator).result()
   counts = result.get_counts()
   
   # Visualize results
   plot_histogram(counts)
   ```

### 5. Experiment with Variations
   - Modify parameters to explore different quantum states and operations.
   - Extend the notebook by integrating hybrid quantum-classical approaches.
   - Try different optimizers and feature maps in quantum machine learning models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Qiskit and its dependencies
- IBM Quantum Experience (optional for cloud execution)
- Internet connection (for package installation and cloud-based simulations)

## Notes
- **IBM Quantum Backend**: If using real quantum hardware, ensure your IBM Quantum Experience account is properly set up.
- **Performance Considerations**: Running quantum simulations on local machines may be slower than cloud-based execution.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter errors related to `qiskit-aer`, ensure you have the latest version installed. For complex quantum computations, consider running them on IBM Quantum hardware.
- **Visualization Support**: Ensure `matplotlib` is installed for plotting quantum measurement results.
- **Future Enhancements**: Consider adding Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) implementations.
